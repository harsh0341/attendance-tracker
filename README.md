# Attendance Tracker

Netcentric Programming Project. 

A basic Attendance Tracker which uses JSP, JDBC and MySQL.


## Requirements 

For this software to work, we would require some specific changes and software to go ahead and work properly.
Following are the requirements:
  - Apache Netbeans IDE 11.1.
  - Visual Studio 1.36.
  - MySQL version 8.0.15.
  - MySQL Connector (JDBC) 5.1.48.
  - JSTL 1.2 jar file.
  - MySQL Connector Java Binary 8.0.15.

For running the software in the optimal way, we recommend to use 11.1 Version of Apache Netbeans IDE. The main use of VSCode is to support rapid development and modifications. The MySQL configuration inside in your system should have root user with database created according to the application. We should keep the jstl java runtime file  inside `/web/WEB-INF/lib/` directory. For the MySQLConnector and MySQL Connector Java Binary we would require to keep it in `build/web/WEB-INF/lib/`.
